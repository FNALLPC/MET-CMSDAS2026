# MET CMSDAS Exercise repository

This repository contains code use for several years for each CMS Data Analysis School, and therefore there is one branch for the specific CMSDAS school. 

## For students

If you want to follow the CMSDAS short MET exercise check the website: [http://erdemyigit.github.io/MET-CMSDAS2026/](http://erdemyigit.github.io/MET-CMSDAS2026/)

The latest version of the school is on January 2026 and therefore use the branch `main`:

```
git clone git@github.com:erdemyigit/MET-CMSDAS2026.git -b main
```


## For contributors

This is the master branch which contains all the code used in several CMSDAS schools. This means that many of the code is obsolete or uses tools that are not longer recommended by CMS. 

### To update the website

The website uses the [carpentry software](https://github.com/carpentries/styles/). If you want to modify it, use the `gh-pages` branch and follow the recommendations from the carpentry style.

The tutorial is designed to be executed at cmslpc and followed in the [METDAS 2026 website](http://erdemyigit.github.io/MET-CMSDAS2026), where you find links to instructional slides and instructions that walk you through the exercises.
