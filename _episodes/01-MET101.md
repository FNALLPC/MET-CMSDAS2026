title: "Missing Transverse Energy 101"
teaching: 20 
exercises: 10
questions:
- "What is MET?"
- "How is MET calculated?"
- "Examples of analyses with MET at CMS"
objectives:
- "Learn about MET, the definition, types and reclustering algorithms."
- "Learn about extracting MET."
keypoints:
- Weakly interacting neutral particles produced in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the LHC traverse the CMS detector unobserved.
- Their presence is inferred from the measurable momentum imbalance in the plane perpendicular to the beam direction when produced alongside electromagnetically charged or neutral particles. This measurable transverse momentum imbalance is referred to as missing transverse momentum (MET).
- Precise determination of MET is critical for: Standard Model measurements involving final states with neutrinos and searches for physics beyond the SM targeting new weakly interacting particles.
- MET reconstruction is sensitive to: experimental resolutions and mismeasurements of reconstructed particles, detector artifacts, the effects of additional pp interactions within the same or nearby bunch crossings (pileup).
